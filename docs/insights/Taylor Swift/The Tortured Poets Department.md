# The Tortured Poets Department

## Fortnight

[Verse 1: Taylor Swift]

I was supposed to be sent away

But they forgot to come and get me

I was a **functioning alcoholic** 功能性酗酒者

'Til nobody noticed my new **aesthetic** 美学的；美感的；

All of this to say I hope you're okay

But you're the reason

And no one here's to blame 这不能怪任何人

But what about your quiet **treason** 背叛；不忠 ?

[Chorus: Taylor Swift]

And for a fortnight there, we were forever

Run into you sometimes, ask about the weather

Now you're in my backyard, turned into good neighbors

Your wife waters flowers, I wanna kill her

[Verse 2: Taylor Swift, Taylor Swift & Post Malone, Post Malone]

All my mornings are Mondays stuck in an endless February

I took the **miracle** 奇迹；不可思议的事 **move-on** 前进 drug, the effects were temporary

And I love you, it's ruining my life

I touched you for only a fortnight

[Chorus: Taylor Swift, Taylor Swift & Post Malone]

And for a fortnight there, we were together

Run into you sometimes, comment on my **sweater** 毛衣；针织衫

Now you're at the mailbox, turned into good neighbors

My husband is cheating, I wanna kill him

[Outro: Post Malone, Post Malone & Taylor Swift, Taylor Swift]

Thought of callin' ya, but you won't pick up

'Nother fortnight lost in America

Move to Florida, buy the car you want

But it won't start up 'til you touch, touch, touch me

torture 折磨；使痛苦 tortured 受苦的；受难的

:::

[Verse 1]
You left your typewriter at my apartment **straight from** the tortured poets department

:::tip

Go straight from here to the traffic light.

:::

I think some things I never say like, "Who uses typewriters anyway?"

But you're in self-**sabotage** mode

:::tip

sabotage 破坏 self-sabotage 自暴自弃

:::

Throwing **spikes** 尖刺 down on the road

But I've seen this **episode** 电视剧里的一集 and still loved the show

Who else decodes you?

[Chorus]

And who's gonna hold you like me?

And who's gonna know you, if not me?

I laughed in your face and said "You're not Dylan Thomas, I'm not Patti Smith. This ain't the **Chelsea** 切尔西 Hotel, we'rе modern idiots"

And who's gonna hold you like me?

[Verse 2]

You smokеd, then ate seven bars of chocolate

We declared Charlie Puth should be a bigger artist

I **scratch** 抓伤；划破 your head, you fall asleep like a tattooed **golden retriever** 金毛猎犬

But you awaken with **dread** 恐惧

**Pounding nails** 敲钉子 in your head

But I've read this one where you come undone

I chose this **cyclone** 热带风暴 with you

[Bridge]

Sometimes, I wonder if you're gonna **screw** this **up** with me

But you told Lucy you'd kill yourself if I ever leave

And I had said that to Jack about you, so I felt seen

Everyone we know understands why it's **meant to be** 命中注定的

'Cause we're crazy

So tell me, who else is gonna know me?

At dinner, you take my ring off my middle finger

And put it on the one people put **wedding rings** on

And that's the closest I've come to my heart exploding

## Down Bad

[Verse 1]

Did you really **beam** 传送 me up

In a cloud of sparkling dust

:::tip

sparkle 闪耀；闪烁

sprinkle 洒；小雨

:::

Just to do experiments on?

Tell me I was the chosen one

Showed me that this world is bigger than us

Then sent me back where I came from

[Pre-Chorus]

For a moment, I knew **cosmic** 宇宙的 love

[Chorus]

Now I'm down bad, cryin' at the gym

Everything comes out teenage **petulance** 易怒；性急

"What if I can't have him"

"I might just die, it would make no difference"

Down bad, wakin' up in blood

Starin' at the sky, come back and pick me up

What if I can't have us

I might just not get up, I might stay

[Verse 2]

Did you take all my old clothes

Just to leave me here, naked and alone

In a field in my same old town

That somehow seems so **hollow** 空洞的；空虚的 now?

They'll say I'm **nuts** 发疯的；精神失常的 if I talk about the existence of you

[Bridge]

I loved your **hostile** 敌对的；敌意的 takeovers 收购；接管

**Encounters** 邂逅；对峙；交锋 closer and closer

All your **indecent** 猥亵的；下流的 exposures

How dare you say that it's—

I'll build you a **fort** 堡垒；要塞 on some planet

Where they can all understand it

How dare you think it's romantic

Leaving me safe and **stranded** 搁浅的；困于某地的

## So Long, London

[Verse 1]

I saw in my mind **fairy lights** 小彩灯 through the **mist** 薄雾

:::tip

fairy 小仙女

:::

I kept calm and carried the weight of the **rift** 裂痕；裂缝

Pulled him in tighter each time he was **drift**in' 漂流；飘移 away

My **spine** 脊柱 split from carrying us up the hill

**Wet through** 湿透了 my clothes, **weary** 疲倦的 bones caught the **chill** 寒冷；着凉

I stopped tryna make him laugh, stopped tryna **drill** 钻 the safe

[Chorus]

Thinkin', "How much sad did you think I had, did you think I had, in me?"

Oh, the **tragedy** 悲剧

So long, London

You'll find someone

[Verse 2]

I didn't **opt in** 选择加入；同意参与 to be your odd man out

I founded the club she's heard great things about

I left all I knew, you left me at the house by the **Heath** 荒地；荒野

I stoppеd CPR 心肺复苏术, after all, it's no use

The spirit was gonе, we would never come to

And I'm pissed off you let me give you all that youth for free

[Chorus]

For so long, London

**Stitches** 缝线 undone

Two graves, one gun

I'll find someone

[Bridge]

And you say I abandoned the ship

But I was going down with it

My **white-knuckle** 惊险的；令人胆战心惊的 dying **grip** 握紧；抓牢

:::tip

knuckle 指关节

:::

Holding tight to your quiet **resentment** 怨恨；不满

And my friends said it isn't right to be scared

Every day of a love affair

Every breath feels like **rarest** 半熟半生的；罕见的 air

When you're not sure if he wants to be there

[Chorus]

Oh, the tragedy

Just how low did you

Think I'd go 'fore I'd self-**implode** 内爆?

'Fore I'd have to go be free?

[Verse 3]

You swore that you loved me, but where were the clues?

I died on the **altar** 祭坛 waitin' for the proof

You sacrificed us to the gods of your bluest days

And I'm just getting color back into my face

I'm just mad as hell 'cause I loved this place for

## Florida!!!

[Verse 1: Taylor Swift]

You can beat the heat if you beat the charges too

:::tip

There’s a **pun** on the word "heat":

- trying to cool down in hot weather, in places such as Florida.
- increased police attention
- abuse (虐待；辱骂；滥用) or criticism

:::

They said I was a cheat, I guess it must be true

And my friends all smell like **weed** 杂草；烟草；大麻 or little babies

:::tip

alluding to the feeling of all her friends being in different life stages

:::

And this city reeks of driving myself crazy

:::tip

The room reeks of smoke.

And this city reeks of things (that driving) myself crazy

:::

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift]

Little did you know your home's really only a town you're just a guest in

So you work your life away just to pay for a time-share down in Destin

:::tip

We're working away. 努力工作

Destin is a city in Florida that serves as a popular tourist destination.

:::

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Florence Welch, Taylor Swift]

Florida is one hell of a drug. Florida Can I **use** you **up**? 用完；耗尽

:::tip

Your boys took one hell of a beating! 你的孩子们被狠狠暴揍了一顿！

:::

[Verse 2: Florence Welch, Taylor Swift & Florence Welch]

The **hurricane** with my name when it came

I got drunk and I dared it to **wash** me **away** 冲走

**Barricaded** 封锁；路障 in the bathroom with a bottle of wine

Well, me and my ghosts, wе had **a hell of a time** 糟糕的/痛苦的时光

Yes, I'm hauntеd, but I'm feeling just fine

All my girls got their lace and their crimes

And your cheating husband disappeared, well

No one asks any questions here

So I did my best to **lay to rest** 入土为安；安息吧

All of the bodies that have ever been on my body and in my mind, they sink into the **swamp** 沼泽；湿地

Is that a bad thing to say in a song?

[Pre-Chorus: Florence Welch]

Little did you know your home's really only the town you'll get arrested

So you pack your life away just to wait out the firestorm back in Texas

:::tip

You gotta **pack** all your cares **away** 把你的忧虑收拾起来扔掉

:::

[Bridge: Taylor Swift, Florence Welch, Taylor Swift & Florence Welch]

I need to forget, so take me to Florida

I've got some **regrets** 后悔；遗憾, I'll bury them in Florida

Tell me I'm despicable 卑鄙的；下流的, say it's unforgivable

At least the dolls are beautiful, fuck me up, Florida

What a crash, what a rush, fuck me up, Florida

It's one hell of a drug

Love left me like this and I don't want to exist

So take me to Florida
